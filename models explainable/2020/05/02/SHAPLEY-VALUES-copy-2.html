<p>I already read a lot of articles about Shapley Values, but none of them make me feel easy to understand, that is why I decided to write this article. I hope this article can help you have another way to understand this value.</p>

<p>So, what is Shapley Value? It’s a value representing the contribution of each person in a cooperative task.</p>

<p>Before goes deeper into the definition and computation of the Shapley value, let’s play a game.</p>

<p>Imagine that A, B, C are working together on a task, how do we know each other’s contributions is?</p>

<p>Imagine also that our current goal is to calculate the marginal contribution of player C.</p>

<p>To do this we create all subsets excluding C and group them into 3 groups: group with 0 people, group with 1 people, group with 2 people.</p>

<p>Assume that f is a task outcome function. We calculate f(∅),f(A),f(B) and f(A,B).
Then when we calculate the outcome when C came in: f(∅,C),f(A,C),f(B,C) and f(A,B,C).</p>

<p>Next, we have an average contribution of C in each group:</p>

<p>The average contribution of C in in-group has 1 people</p>

<p>The average contribution of C in in-group has 2 people
Then we take an average for all groups:</p>

<p>In general, the shapely value can also be expressed as:</p>

<p>Where n is the total number of people, v is a value function.</p>
